# NIST-SRD-46-Dataset-Explorer

The NIST SRD 46 dataset contains imprtoant information about a range of important metals and ligands. The dataset is a great resource for many chemists and electrochemists. However, the database has been discontinued since around 2006 and there are no official apps that can be used to explore and visualize the dataset. Dr. Hatada from Kyoto University has created a Sqlite batabase for the SRD-46 dataset and also created a handy app called "Stability Constant Explorer" to explore the database which can be found [here](https://github.com/n-hatada/stability-constant-explorer).

While useful for visualization, Dr. Hatada's Stability Constant Explorer app and the Sqlite database can be cumbersome for automatically exploration for machine learning purposes and do not work on all operating systems. Here, the database used for Stability Constant Explorer app is cleaned and is provided as a csv file with all the references in the same table. A streamlit app is created on top of the csv file that provides the same functionality as Stability Constant Explorer app. The app is hosted online, so no installation is required and the database can be explored from any platform (Linux, Mac, or Windows). Having the references in the same table as a column enables automated scraping of the journal articles.
